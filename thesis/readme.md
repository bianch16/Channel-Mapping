### Issues on mmwave communications 

[An Overview of Signal Processing Techniques
for Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7400949)
* clearly describe the problem, current solution in mmwave communications, it is of vital importance in this field.

### Sth on the dual-band system

[Estimating Millimeter Wave Channels Using
Out-of-Band Measurements](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7888146/)
* This paper uses some method to tranform spatial correlation matrix from a low freq to mmwave freq.

[Deep Learning Predictive Band Switching in
Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05305v1.pdf)
* Use deep learning to decide whether to switch from 3.5G to 28G band(vise versa)

### Pilot aided approach in mmwave CE

[Channel Estimation for mmWave Massive MIMO
Based Access and Backhaul in Ultra-Dense Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7511578)

* This paper points out that when in the UDN(Ultra-Dense Network) case, even in mmwave the SNR is still high.

### Deep learning based channel-mapping
